### The words (features) and authors (labels), already largely processed.
### These files should have been created from the previous (Lesson 10)
### mini-project.
words_file = "../9text_learning/your_word_data.pkl"
authors_file = "../9text_learning/your_email_authors.pkl"
word_data = pickle.load( open(words_file, "r"))

### test_size is the percentage of events assigned to the test set (the
### remainder go into training)
### feature matrices changed to dense representations for compatibility with
### classifier functions in versions 0.15.2 and earlier
from sklearn import model_selection
features_train, features_test, labels_train, labels_test = \
    model_selection.train_test_split(word_data, authors, test_size=0.1, random_state=42)

vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(sublinear_tf=True, max_df=0.5,
                             stop_words='english')
features_train = vectorizer.fit_transform(features_train)
features_test  = vectorizer.transform(features_test).toarray()
words=vectorizer.get_feature_names()

### a classic way to overfit is to use a small number
### of data points and a large number of features;
### train on only 150 events to put ourselves in this regime
features_train = features_train[:150].toarray()
labels_train   = labels_train[:150]



### your code goes here
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
clf=DecisionTreeClassifier()
clf.fit(features_train,labels_train)
pred=clf.predict(features_test)
print len(pred)
print len(features_test)

from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
accuracyDT=accuracy_score(pred,labels_test)
print 'accuracyDT:',accuracyDT
importance=clf.feature_importances_
for i,value in enumerate(importance):
    if value >0.2:
        print value,i
        print words[i]
